SoundnessLabs Testnet Goes Live!

The future of zk is being built in real-time — and now you can be part of it. SoundnessLabs has officially launched its testnet, opening the doors for builders, validators, and early adopters to explore next-gen zero-knowledge infrastructure. 

From proving systems to scalable interoperability, the testnet is your chance to get hands-on, stress-test the stack, and help shape the foundation of tomorrow’s decentralized future.
